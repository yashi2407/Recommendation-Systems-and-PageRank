Title:
ðŸ“Š Recommendation Engines & PageRank Algorithm (Matrix & Spark)

Description:
Built end-to-end implementations of user-user and item-item collaborative filtering using cosine similarity matrices on a real-world TV show dataset. Also implemented the PageRank algorithm from scratch using both NumPy and distributed Spark RDDs on a 1000-node graph.

Extracted similarity matrices using matrix factorization techniques

Used cosine similarity for personalized recommendations

Applied PageRank with iterative vector updates (Î² = 0.8)

Leveraged Apache Spark to process large-scale graph data efficiently

Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Apache Spark

Context: Academic project for "Big Data and Analytics" at The George Washington University
